       security architecture for 6top: requirements and structure
            draft-richardson-6tisch-security-architecture-00

Abstract

   This document details minimal layer-2 requirements for 6top use in
   industrial settings, and a few options for accomplishing this.  The
   layer-2 mechanism is then extended to provide for per-node
   authentication and authorization of the node/PCE communications.
   This internet-draft is intended for later inclusion into the 6tisch
   architecture document.

Internet-Draft               6tisch-security               December 2013


   This is an adaptation of the process described in [ZigBeeIP], section
   and expounded upon in section 6.3: "Network Discovery", 6.4: "Network
   Selection", and 6.5, "Node Joining".  The process is abridged below.

6.1.  Network Discovery

   The MAC beacon facility is used.  A critical difference in 6tisch
   from ZigBee IP is that because nodes transmit and receive according
   to their own schedule, every node is in essence a coordinator.  While
   nodes may sleep a lot, they will not in general be sleep Hosts, from
   a ZigBee IP point of view, and MLE is not necessary.

   Each response to the Beacon is a potential network-joining-parent.

   As an option, it may be desireable for this document to define a well
   known NetworkID.

6.2.  PANA protocol

   The PANA payloads MUST be relayed by the chosen network-joining-
   parent.  It is assumed that the PANA Authentication Agent is co-
   located with the PCE, if there is a PCE.

   As per section 8.3.4 of [ZigBeeIP], the PANA process runs over UDP
   using link-layer addressing.  The process is first the PANA
   initialization (PCI, PAR:S, PAN:S), followed by EAP initialization
   (EAP-Request, EAP-Response), which negotiates the identity, and then
   EAP-TLS starts, consisting of (TLS(Start), TLS(ClientHello),
   TLS(ServerHello), TLS(ServerKeyExchange), TLS(ClientKeyExchange), and
   TLS(ChangeCipherSpec)).

   When the TLS is done, the EAP derives new network security material,
   and sends it encrypted using the Encr-Encap AVP described in
   [RFC6786].

6.3.  Authorization

   QUESTION: can we find a way for the authorization protocol, such as
   described in draft-gerdes-core-dcaf-authorize-01, to run
   simultaenously with the authentication system if we assume that the
   dcaf AS is also the PANA Authentication Server/Agent

   In the context of draft-selander-core-access-control, the new node
   that is joining is the resource server, and the origin client is the
   PCE.

7.  option 2: The WirelessHart/ISA100 way
