zerotouch:
- requirement for no provisioning keys, at installation time.
              - provisioning step?
              - factory

  - access control vs touchless mechanism for provisioning. NOT THE SAME THING.
  - the network MUST be secure against introduction of not-yet authorized
    devices, from not yet same manufacturer/VAR/

Behringer flow... agreement between vendor and deployer.
          vendor ships sensors... and some certificates... and may or may not
          depend upon the deployment.

  - when the device is deployed, it goes home to the vendor and goes back to
    the vendor.

- ZERO TOUCH refers to touching the SENSOR, not implying that the network
  and infrastructure need not by updated.
  - and also NEVER TOUCHED

- GENUINE DEVICE vs RESILIENCE Against NORTEL EFFECT
- the second hand market support.... replacing the vendor.


- JS: for some devices without horsepower; adoption from existing efforts,
      some advantages to support.
      What was written before: not exclude protocols that can not do PSK, but
      support it if we can.

- JS: protocol must protect battery against asymmetric Denial of Service.
- PT: suggests ignore small devices and small devices, we want large scale
      and class 2 devices.

- JS Zero Touch is important for scale.
  if we can tolerate "if you want to use PSK, then you will give up ZT, here
                       are the ways that you can do that, but ...!"

- TP agrees.
- RS agrees.
- Maik Seeward.


====
SD: would like to fit in to existing AAA.
    TLS vs DTLS?  maybe.

TP: if we don't have asymmetric, then we need another proximity mechanism.
    some kind of proximity system.
    stronger concern about intrusion.

 ... is WIFI / PEAP/etc. being used?
 ... as long as provisioning process is viewed as disjoint....
 - in large sites... acquisition stages... things that could be done at that
 stage to authorize things.

JS: anecdotal... wirelessHART community... the people who are operating the
    networks do not want interaction with the IT department.
TP: to go even further, the control room people are different then the people
    who install... are even further from the IT people.
    "Joe Screwdriver"... just install parts.  "Is it working"
    Proximity devices are good for validation.

    ISA100A -- every LED is a photodiode... for bidirectional... optical
                output is a reversable channel....

JS: voice of the developer... the only big concern about EAP/TLS vs DTLS, is
    that it is two things to test.

JS --- 3DES/SHA1 mandatory... crypto suite concerns.... do not want to
   implement older crypto.
