                     6tisch secure join using 6top
              draft-richardson-6tisch-table-of-contents-00

Abstract

   This document details a security architecture that permits a new
   6tisch compliant node to join a 802.15.4e/6tisch network.  The
   process provides just enough end to end connectivity to permit a
   network management process to reach out to the new node and provision
   it using 6top over CoAP/DTLS.  The process is zero-touch using
   autonomic mechanisms, requiring no direct provisioning step.  Any
   resemblance to WirelessHART/IEC62591 is entirely intentional.

1.  security requirements

   The ultimate goal of the join protocol is to provide a new node with
   enough locally significant security credentials that it is able to
   take part in the network directly.  The credentials may vary by
   deployment.  They can be:

       a network-wide shared symmetric key

       a locally significant (one-level only) certificate

   Given one of the the above, there are a number of possible protocols
   that can be used to generate layer-2 sessions keys for the node,
   including:

       Mesh Link Exchange [I-D.kelsey-intarea-mesh-link-establishment]

1.1.  thread model

1.2.  implementation cost

   (storage of security material, computational cost)

1.3.  denial of service

   other communication impacts of security protocol mechanics

2.  protocol requirements/constraints/assumptions

2.1.  inline/offline

   dependencies on centralized or external functionality, inline and
   offline

3.  time sequence diagram

3.1.  explanation of each step

3.1.1.  step (1): beacon

   A 6tisch join/synchronization beacon is broadcast periodically, and
   is authenticated with a symmetric "beacon key":

      well known JOIN key, such "JOIN6TISCH"

      another key, provisioned in advance (OOB)

      a shared symmetric key derived from public part of top level
      certificate (a closely held "secret")

   The purpose of this key is not to provide a high level of assurance,
   but rather to filter out 6tisch traffic from another random traffic
   that may be sharing the same radio frequencies.

   These beacons are used for JOIN purpose only, and are not related to
   the Enhanced Beacons used in the rest of 6tisch.

3.1.2.  step (2): acquire authorizer key

   Step (4) will involve doing a public key encryption to node
   performing the authorization management role.  In order to do this,
   the new node needs to know the public key of the manager, and so in
   this step it requests that certificate from the neighbour that that
   it received the beacon from.

3.1.3.  step (3): receive authorizer key

   the proxy neighbour sends the key in one or more messages, along with
   the address of the authorizing server.  The address of the
   authorization server could be an attribute of the certificate that is
   received.

3.1.4.  step (4): join request

   This message is addressed to the authorizing node at layer 3, and the
   proxy simply forwards the message.

3.2.  size of each packet

   and number of frames needed to contain it.

4.  resulting security properties obtained from this process

5.  deployment scenarios underlying protocol requirements

6.  device identification

6.1.  PCE/Proxy vs Node identification

6.2.  Time source authentication / time validation

   Note: RPL Root authentication is a chartered item

6.3.  description of certificate contents

6.4.  privacy aspects

7.  slotframes to be used during join

   how is this communicated in the (extended) beacon.

8.  configuration aspects

   (allocation of slotframes after join, network statistics,
   neighboetc.)

9.  authorization aspects

   lifecycle (key management, trust management)

9.1.  how to determine a proxy/PCE from a end node

9.2.  security considerations

   what prevents a node from transmitting when it is not their turn
   (part one: jamming)

   can a node successfully communicate with a peer at a time when not
   supposed to, may be tied to link layer security, or will it be
   policed by receiver?

10.  security architecture

   security architecture and fit of e.g. join protocol and provisioning
   into this

11.  Posture Maintenance

   (SACM related work)

12.  Security Considerations

13.  Other Related Protocols

14.  IANA Considerations
