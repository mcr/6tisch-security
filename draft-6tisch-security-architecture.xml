<abstract>
  <t>
    This document details minimal layer-2 requirements for 6top use in
    industrial settings, and a few options for accomplishing this.
    The layer-2 mechanism is then extended to provide for per-node
    authentication and authorization of the node/PCE communications.
    This internet-draft is intended for later inclusion into the 6tisch
    architecture document.

<section title="option 1: The ZigBeeIP/PANA way">
<t>
This is an adaptation of the process described in <xref target="ZigBeeIP"/>, section
and expounded upon in section 6.3: "Network Discovery", 6.4: "Network Selection", and 6.5, "Node Joining".
The process is abridged below.
</t>
<section title="Network Discovery">
<t>
The MAC beacon facility is used.  A critical difference in 6tisch from ZigBee IP is that
because nodes transmit and receive according to their own schedule, every node is in
essence a coordinator.  While nodes may sleep a lot, they will not in general be sleep Hosts, from a
ZigBee IP point of view, and MLE is not necessary.
</t>
<t>
Each response to the Beacon is a potential network-joining-parent.
</t>
<t>
As an option, it may be desireable for this document to define a well known NetworkID.
</t>
</section>

<section title="PANA protocol">
<t>
The PANA payloads MUST be relayed by the chosen network-joining-parent.  It is assumed that the
PANA Authentication Agent is co-located with the PCE, if there is a PCE.
</t>
<t>
As per section 8.3.4 of <xref target="ZigBeeIP"/>, the PANA process runs over UDP using link-layer
addressing.  The process is first the PANA initialization (PCI, PAR:S, PAN:S),
followed by EAP initialization (EAP-Request, EAP-Response), which negotiates the identity,
and then EAP-TLS starts, consisting of (TLS(Start), TLS(ClientHello), TLS(ServerHello),
TLS(ServerKeyExchange), TLS(ClientKeyExchange), and TLS(ChangeCipherSpec)).
</t>
<t>
When the TLS is done, the EAP derives new network security material, and sends it encrypted
using the Encr-Encap AVP described in <xref target="RFC6786"/>.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Authorization">
<t>
QUESTION: can we find a way for the authorization protocol, such as described in draft-gerdes-core-dcaf-authorize-01, to run simultaenously with the authentication system if we assume that the dcaf AS
is also the PANA Authentication Server/Agent
</t>
<t>
In the context of draft-selander-core-access-control, the new node that is joining is the resource server,
and the origin client is the PCE.
